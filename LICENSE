All the material in here is completely free as I possess no ownership for any of the underlying games. You may use this material in any way
you can think of. You do now even need to mention my name. But you do it on your own risk. Don't blame me for any accidents
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fun project. All material is tested to a certain extent only and never by an independent QA department. This is always inacceptable
for any development. So, expext tons of errors and stupidity. Some of the code even isn't fully understood. This gives you many opportunities
or improvement. If you found something interesting, try to let me kow. Maybe you get an answer, probably you will be ignored, for sure if you
are unkind.

A reassembly of any game source should always produce an exact binary copy of the original. As this can easily be checked there will be no
exception of this rule. This is, of course, impossible for the modified sources. Here you should always expect the worst.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If some material infringes your Copyrights, please do not unleash your lawyers. Simply drop me a line and I remove the material in question.

Have fun
